"""### Train Test Split  
Out of Sample Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that that the model has NOT been trained on. Doing a train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample accuracy, due to the likelihood of being over-fit.

It is important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy, because the purpose of any model, of course, is to make correct predictions on unknown data. So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to use an evaluation approach called Train/Test Split.
Train/Test Split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. 

This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems."""

# Classification 

## K nearest neighbor (K-NN)

#### Import library 

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

### Training

"""Lets start the algorithm with k=4 for now:
"""
k = 4
#Train Model and Predict  
neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)
neigh

### Predicting
"""we can use the model to predict the test set:
"""
yhat = neigh.predict(X_test)
yhat[0:5]

### Accuracy evaluation

"""In multilabel classification, __accuracy classification score__ function computes subset accuracy. This function is equal to the jaccard_similarity_score function. Essentially, it calculates how match the actual labels and predicted labels are in the test set."""

print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh.predict(X_train)))

"""
Can you build the model again, but this time with k=6?
"""
