## Decision Trees

When building a decision tree, we want to split the nodes in a way that 
  1-  Decreases entropy 
        and 
  2-  Increases information gain.


Machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. 
This classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their respond to different medications.

 Then use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
